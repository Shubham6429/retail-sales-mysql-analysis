# Retail Sales SQL Analysis

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of a retail sales dataset using MySQL 8.0.
The project was done to practice writing real-world SQL queries focused on data cleaning, exploration, and business-style analysis.

The database was created manually in MySQL Workbench, and all queries were written independently as part of hands-on SQL practice.
